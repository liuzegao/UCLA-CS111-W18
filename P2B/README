- SortedList.h - a header file containing interfaces for linked list operations.
- SortedList.c - the source for a C source module that compiles cleanly (with no errors or warnings), and implements insert, delete, lookup, and length methods for a sorted doubly linked list (described in the provided header file, including correct placement of pthread_yield calls).
- lab2_list.c - the source for a C program that compiles cleanly (with no errors or warnings), and implements the specified command line options (--threads, --iterations, --yield, --sync, --lists), drives one or more parallel threads that do operations on a shared linked list, and reports on the final list and performance. 
- A Makefile to build the deliverable programs, output, graphs, and tarball. The higher level targets should be:
    - default ... the lab2_list executable (compiling with the -Wall and -Wextra options).
    - tests ... run all specified test cases to generate CSV results
    - profile ... run tests with profiling tools to generate an execution profiling report
    - graphs ... use gnuplot to generate the required graphs
    - dist ... create the deliverable tarball
    - clean ... delete all programs and output generated by the Makefile
- lab2b_list.csv - containing your results for all of test runs.
- profile.out - execution profiling report showing where time was spent in the un-partitioned spin-lock implementation.
- graphs (.png files), created by gnuplot(1) on the above csv data showing:
    - lab2b_1.png ... throughput vs. number of threads for mutex and spin-lock synchronized list operations.
    - lab2b_2.png ... mean time per mutex wait and mean time per operation for mutex-synchronized list operations.
    - lab2b_3.png ... successful iterations vs. threads for each synchronization method.
    - lab2b_4.png ... throughput vs. number of threads for mutex synchronized partitioned lists.
    - lab2b_5.png ... throughput vs. number of threads for spin-lock-synchronized partitioned lists.
    - any other files or scripts required to generate your results.
- a README file containing:
    - descriptions of each of the included files and any other information about your submission that you would like to bring to our attention (e.g. research, limitations, features, testing methodology).
    - brief (a few sentences per question) answers to each of the questions (below).
