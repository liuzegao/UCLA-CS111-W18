- lab3a.c (at least) one C/C++ source module that compiles cleanly with no errors or warnings).
- Makefile to build and run the deliverable program. The higher level targets should be:
    default ... compile your program (with the -Wall and -Wextra options) to produce an executable named lab3a
    dist ... create the deliverable tarball
    clean ... delete all programs and output generated by the Makefile.
- README text file containing descriptions of each of the included files and any other information
