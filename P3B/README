- (at least) one source module that builds/executes cleanly with no errors or warnings.
- Makefile to build and run the deliverable program. The higher level targets should be:
    default ... build your program to produce an executable named lab3b
    dist ... create the deliverable tarball
    clean ... delete all programs and output generated by the Makefile, and return the directory to its freshly un-tar-ed state.
- README text file containing descriptions of each of the included files and any other information about your submission that you would like to bring to our attention (e.g., research, limitations, features, testing methodology).
